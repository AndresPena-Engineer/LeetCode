# LeetCode Solutions
This repository is dedicated for all the LeetCode code challenges that I have finished. If there are multiple solutions for a specific problem, 
it is because I have solved the problem in multiple languages. The full description and constraints for each problem is explained in detail in 
the comment section of the code. Along with the tolal number of test cases passed, runtime, and memory usage (see comments at the bottom in each code file).

# Defanging an IP Address
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

# Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

# Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

# Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note: s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single 
space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

# Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

# Valid Palinddrome
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
